Solution Strategy
**************************************
My main solution strategy was to mimic
the behavior of the bash shell. I went
through each type of command(with
arguments, without arguments, etc) and
implemented it, then compared its output
to bash's. When I ran into difficulties
I consulted to Bash and Linux user
manuals.

**************************************
Assumptions
**************************************
I assumed that if a command worked in
bash it should work in my shell. All
of my custom commands do not work if
tried to run in the background. If a
'>' or '<' sign is in a command, I
assume that there is only one argument
following it.
